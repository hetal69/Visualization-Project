# Statistical Analysis and Visualization of Student Grades

This project explores the relationship between "Previous Qualification (Grade)" and "Admission Grade" using Python. Through data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and various visualizations, the project reveals insights into the characteristics and patterns of these variables.

**Key Steps:**

   - **Data Preprocessing:** Loading data, selecting relevant columns, and handling missing or non-numeric values.

   - **Statistical Analysis:** Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, variance, and identification of outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

**Visualizations:**

   - **Box Plot:** Highlights data distribution and outliers.

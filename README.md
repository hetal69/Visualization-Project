# Statistical Analysis and Visualization of Student Grades

This project explores the relationship between "Previous Qualification (Grade)" and "Admission Grade" using Python. Through data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and various visualizations, the project reveals insights into the characteristics and patterns of these variables.

**Key Steps:**

   - **Data Preprocessing:** Loading data, selecting relevant columns, and handling missing or non-numeric values.

   - **Statistical Analysis:** Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, variance, and identification of outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

**Visualizations:**

   - **Box Plot:** Highlights data distribution and outliers.

   - **Seaborn Scatter Plot:** Displays the relationship between the two variables.

   - **Linear Regression:** Shows the trend and strength of the relationship.

   - **Heatmap:** Visualizes the correlation between variables.

This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset.
